# AoC2023_c_solutions

## Code
All in c. This is not a _good_ choice, just a principled stance to use the language I know best. I reserve the right to switch to COQ at some point, but in the event this switch occurs, please contact the authorities.

## Optimizations
I'm not trying to optimize this year and present O-notation for my algorithms. I have too much going on in my life, and in any case, I ended up giving up on this halfway through last year.

That said, I will try to clean up my code to make it as useful as possible. 

## I hope this helps you

I know I am one of a few lost souls using C to complete these challenges, so I hope my approaches to each problem will be helpful for people trying to work lower in the memory. That said, I am not manipulating registers here. I am compiling portable c code on both Intel syntax and M1 Macs. In the future I hope to complete some of these challenges on some embedded system, but for now, I've got access to every library I could possibly need.
